# Installation

## Conda environment

We recommend installing PyTomoATT in a conda environment to ensure compatibility with the required dependencies.

```{note}
If you don't already have Conda installed, you can download and install it from the official Conda website: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
```

### Create a new Conda environment

Create a new Conda environment for Pytomoatt with the following command:
```

```
conda activate pytomoatt
```
